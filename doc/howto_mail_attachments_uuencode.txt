We need either "uuencode" or "base64"

"base64" is part of "coreutils" and should be available on almost all systems right now.

"uuencode" - where is it?

1st) uuencode is doing a little bit more compared to base64:
	* without -m / without --base64, it uses the 30 jears old UUENCODING, which is not very wide supported anymore
		Header with -m :
			begin 644 attachment.png
		unclear, how to properly embed this into a mail readable by thunderbird
	* with -m ( short for --base64 ) it does the same as base64, but prefixes the mail with a header line
		that seems not to be required since MIME/Multipart
		Header with -m :
			begin-base64 644 attachment.png
		unclear, how to properly embed this into a mail readable by thunderbird
	* with -e, it also base64 encodes the filename of the header line, which could be nice for i18n names,
		but as said, ... seems seems to be not required.
		Header with -me :	
			begin-base64-encoded 644 YXR0YWNobWVudC5wbmc=
		unclear, how to properly embed this into a mail readable by thunderbird

Anyway, you want go with uuencode? ok.

ARCH (Arch based Linux, MSYS)

	which uuencode
	<nothing>
	pkgfile --update
	pkgfile -s uuencode
	<nothing>
	
	(not very descriptive, but google said: "sharutil" contains uuencode)

	pacman -Ss sharutil
	msys/sharutils 4.15.2-1
		Makes so-called shell archives out of many files

	(still not very helpful, but the package name is "sharutils")
	
	pacman -S sharutils
	...
	uuencode -v
		uuencode (GNU sharutils) 4.15.2


DEB (Debian/Ubuntu)

	which uuencode
	<nothing>
	apt search uuencode | grep -B 1 'uuencode'
		sharutils/bionic 1:4.15.2-3
			shar, unshar, uuencode, uudecode

	("sharutils" contains uuencode)
	
	sudo apt install sharutils
	...
	uuencode -v
		uuencode (GNU sharutils) 4.15.2


--- we have it!
okay, the remains are baked into in pomabuse libs this way:

	uuencode -me /path/filename.txt | sendmail -s "Subject of the Mail" -- name_to@example.com


A [completely?] different way ("mutt"):

	echo -e "This is a Mail Body\n2. Line" | mutt -s "Subject of the Mail" -a "./attachment.jpg" -- name_to@example.com
	
Another different tool ("mail"):

	uuencode /path/filename.txt attached_filename.txt | mail -v -s "Subject of the Mail" -r name_from@example.com name_to@example.com

Still another different tool ("mail"):
	mpack -s "Subject of the Mail" /path/filename.txt name_to@example.com
