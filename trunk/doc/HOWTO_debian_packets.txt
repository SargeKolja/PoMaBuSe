packages and tools needed in debian-ish distros:
	bash		#	the program is entirely written in BASH, not DASH, but dash might alos work (pl. open a ticket, if not)
	coreutils	#	head, tail, cp, mv, ..
	findutils	#	xargs
	cut 		#	bash internals, I believe
	grep		#	who could live without?
	sleep 		#	bash internal, I believe
	svn			#	to fetch the sources the PO Mabuse shall compile. as of 2020/Mar/12, this is the only VCS we support, but plans are for git
	openssh		#	service and admintration the build clients // or use Virtual machines with terminal shells
	editor		#	any, i.e. nano, joe, emacs, vim or geany, whatever ...
	build-essential	# or one or more of the following:
	gcc			#	or whatever compiler you prefer
	g++			#	or whatever compiler you prefer
	make		#	most likely
	qt5-default	qttools5-dev-tools	# very likely
	qt4-default	qt4-dev-tools		# or the older one

	sendmail alternative on Ubuntu/Debian: "mSMTP" or Nullmailer, I prefer mSMTP here since years
		sudo apt[-get] install msmtp msmtp-mta					# or just msmtp and then: ln -s /usr/bin/msmtp /usr/sbin/sendmail
		echo "set sendmail=\"/usr/bin/msmtp -t\"" | sudo tee -a /etc/mail.rc					# set as sendmail
		editor /etc/aliases																		# mapping local users to emails
		sudo touch /etc/msmtprc && sudo chmod 600 /etc/msmtprc && sudo editor /etc/msmtprc		# system/root mails
		touch ~/msmtprc && chmod 600 ~/msmtprc && editor ~/msmtprc								# user mails


	not yet tested but should work:
		s-nail (this is POSIX mailx for Arch/Manjaro, also avail in apt for debians/'buntus)
